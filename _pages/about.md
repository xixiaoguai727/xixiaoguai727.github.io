<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the BiWell Lab, City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Yuhan Luo](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/). 

My research interests include conversational agents, multimodal human-AI interaction, emotional AI, healthcare applications of AI, and affective computing. 

Currently, I am focusing on exploring multimodal emotion expression for AI-powered chatbots.
